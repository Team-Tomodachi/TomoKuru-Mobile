# Intro

TomoKuru is an online platform that integrates a user-oriented mobile app and a vendor-orientated web site. The purpose of TomoKuru is to give individual users a new way to meet people with similar hobbies and interests, browse events that are going on in the city, and search for different types of venues where they may host or attend social gatherings. Vendors also have a new way to manage multiple venues to offer various packages that appear on the users venue screen.

Through this mobile app, user can browse and join groups & events while checking out venues available. Once the user has signed in, they can create or join group(s) & event(s). There is a screen to help the user access all the groups & events joined or created. Taking safety into consideration, there is a safety screen where the user can notice their emergency contact or police if needed.
